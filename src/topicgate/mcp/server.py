_SNAPSHOT_INSTRUCTIONS = """Use inspect_broker as the primary read-only broker
inspection tool. It combines profile identity, connection health, subscriptions,
cache usage, and, when requested, a bounded snapshot. get_broker_snapshot,
list_topics, and get_topic_state remain available as legacy compatibility tools.

Snapshots return TopicGate's latest observed state: the last values TopicGate
received and retained in memory or persistence. They are not authoritative broker
history or proof that a value is still current; received_at is when TopicGate saw
the message.

Snapshot results can be stale or partial. Without max_age_seconds, old cached values
may be returned. With max_age_seconds, stale values are omitted and counted in
freshness and result metadata. Always inspect completeness.is_complete,
completeness.limitations, freshness, results, and payload truncation fields. Empty,
limited, or disconnected snapshots can be valid.

Broker selectors accept a UUID or a unique profile name. Names are trimmed and
matched case-insensitively. Unknown names fail; ambiguous names fail rather than
selecting arbitrarily. Call list_brokers and retry with the broker UUID when needed.

query_failure_history is passive and available in every mode. Its response is
bounded; inspect returned_count and next_cursor."""
